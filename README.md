#   — Unsupervised ML Models
**IOD (Institue of Data) Mini Project 3** aims to evaluate a person's potential risk of developing lung-cancer based on their lifestyle factors. The project objective is to simulate a stakeholder presentation and by influencing stakeholders to make insighful decisions based on the population's risk.
